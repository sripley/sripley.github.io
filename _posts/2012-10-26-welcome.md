Like many folks in the technology industry, we crave an innate desire to share our
experiences with a broader audience. A blog is something I've wanted to set-up for some time but, after 6 years at a
start-up and two small children, setting up a blog was not high on the priority list.

Flash forward 6 years. Now that I am taking some time off before returning to work, I have enough, although not as
much as I expected, time to set-up a personal blog. For those of you that read my bio, food and software figure
prominently in my life. Besides my family, I spend more time thinking about software and food than anything
else so a blog focusing on the two is only logical.
